# DataStructProj3
Question one is implemented in DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp, QueueVT.cpp and QueueVT.h. DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp only contains an example of how to use QueueVT.cpp and QueueVT.h, it has no necessary code.
The queue is implemented as a template, but the final line of QueueVT.cpp must be modified in order to avoid unresolved external errors. The file as it is included is set up for the int data type, but modifying the code as instructed in QueueVT.cpp allows for any data type to be used.
The examples in DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp will only work for a queue of type int.

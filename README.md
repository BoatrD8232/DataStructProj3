Question one is implemented in DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp, QueueVT.cpp and QueueVT.h. DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp only contains an example of how to use QueueVT.cpp and QueueVT.h, it has no necessary code.
The queue is implemented as a template, but the final line of QueueVT.cpp must be modified in order to avoid unresolved external errors. The file as it is included is set up for the int data type, but modifying the code as instructed in QueueVT.cpp allows for any data type to be used.
The examples in DataStructQueueTemplate.cpp will only work for a queue of type int. The contents of a queue may be printed using the display funtcion.

Example Execution:
The below screenshot shows a queue being filled with 21 elements and displayed. The pop funciton is then called 22 times in order to clear the list and show the error message when pop is called on an empty list. The empty lis is then displayed.

Question 2 is implemented in DataStruct-RecLinSearch.cpp, Search.cpp and Search.h. DataStruct-RecLinSearch.cpp contains an example of the implmentation of Search.cpp and Search.h. Including Search.h allows the use of linear_search using a vector of int type.

Example Execution:
